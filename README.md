- 👋 Hi, I’m Giselle Rendon.
- 👀 I’m interested in Working as a Data Entry/ VA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything and expand my knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m newbie and I am looking for a work that is related to my field.
- I understand that you need someone to rename your PDF file invoices, and I think I can be a great help to you. As a newbie, I won't waste your time tracking and I will do my best to be good at my job because I need a good feedback and I need to earn money. 
As for my understanding, the job is easy. I had experience it when I was doing my On The JOB training OJT as an encoder. I organize files on our department, rename them according to YYMMDD acquired. I think I can be a great asset to you and to your project.
I am willing to negotiate on terms at it fits to you.
